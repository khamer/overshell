Overshell
=========

Overshell is a shell independent set of scripts and such meant to create a better environment for
command line development. This includes its own set of default settings designed to improve terminal
life as well as some mechanisms to provide shortcuts, aliases, and even alter the behavior of
commands as you see fit.
